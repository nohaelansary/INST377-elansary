# INST377-elansary

Hi, my name is **Noha Elansary** and I am a student in INST377. I am studying Information Science with a minor in Neuroscience. 

I love programming and I love the health field, I am hoping that in the future I am able to combine both my passions to better the health field. 

Through this class, I want to learn how to build web applications and learn to make webpages responsive without using bootstrap.
